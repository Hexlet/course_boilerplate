# Hexlet Course Boilerplate

Courses at Hexlet are stored in Git. This is a generic boilerplate. It works for both text-based and video-based courses.

- `spec.yml` — course name and description
- `image.png` — course cover (will be provided by Hexlet)
- folders `01-name`, `02-name` etc. are lessons. Each lesson cosists of:
  + README.md — lesson text
  + `spec.yml` — lesson name, goal and optional video info

This repo includes 3 complete sample lessons (from *Intro to Programming* course).
